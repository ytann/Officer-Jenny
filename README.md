## Introduction

With the introduction to the games like Pokemon GO which are based on real-time user location there has been an sudden rise in the development of Fake GPS applications to help players spoof and cheat. The ability to spoof has led to degradation of the overall gaming experience and has created negative impact among fellow players. In the early 2019 Niantic filed lawsuits against the developers of such MockGPS applications. Naintic has banned a lot of players in the last few years who were red-flagged as spoofers by their algorithm. Even after all the effort from Niantic there are a lot of players who spoof or use Fake location application to play.

## About Officer-Jenny
